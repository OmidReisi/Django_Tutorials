django-admin     // run this command in terminal to show a list of sub commands for django

django-admin <sub command>      //to execute the sub commands


django-admin startproject <project name>       //to start a django project

//to run a django project we have to use the command below on the manage.py file (from the same directory in the command line)

python manage.py runserver      //run a django project

//if the DEBUG mode is ON then if we make changes to the code it should automatically update the server while it's running

//the concept behind django is the you have your main project the you create with the startproject sub command and you can add different apps to your project (e.g. a blog_app or a store_app)

python manage.py startapp <app name>        //add a app to your project


//in order to use html templates for our HttpResponse instead of strings we need to create the following folder hierarchy for each app in the project

//in the root level of each app we create <templates/"app-name"> folders and place our html templates in them

//in order to use our html template we need to copy the name of the class from our apps.py file from the app and place it in the "INSTALLED_APPS" section of the settings.py in our project (for example add "blog.apps.BlogConfig" to the settings.py file)
